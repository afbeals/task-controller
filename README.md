to do:
//registration = login and redirect
//all styling
//retriving routine updates the total duration of routine (after styling out full routine view)
//form validations
//adjust $scope.presentInDatabase in FE controller_scripts.js
//add remove pin functionality
//move login/register to nav_controller (maybe)


known bugs:

Later features:
//drag and drop task to reorder (updates order # in list)
//update routine instead of having to create new one based
//add in depart at and/or arrive by feature for routine start time
