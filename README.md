to do:
//create navbar
//registration = login and redirect
//all styling
//home location = user home
//retriving routine updates the total duration of routine
//Profile:
	-retrieve routine + Task
//Create-A-Routine:
	-retrieve all previous Task for easy add to new routine
//add login check to all function
//clean up & remove script
//comment out code
//create logout to destroy session / cookie / sessionStorage
//change over to using newRoutine
//form validations
//url = case insensitive

bugs:
//Create-A-Routine: 
	-remove all task button sends error but does remove
	-single remove task button removes but doesn't update
	


Later features:
//adding location drops a pin on map
//drag and drop task to reorder (updates order # in list)
//update routine instead of having to create new one based
